During my 4th year internship at 
.important ALTEN
, I worked on different kinds of projects. Among them, one was answering
.important Atexis 
needs ( Atexis is working for clients such as 
.important Airbus
).

This project consisted in realizing a tool to ease the billing process towards Airbus. 
I won't go into the details in concerns of confidentiality, but the tool could perform the following actions:
%ul
  %li
    Import and treat data generated by the client's ERP
  %li
    Display the information about valuation of work units and save them in a database
  %li
    Allowing modification of work units and filing

On this project, I used .NET technologies (best integration with Microsoft Excel), which are C# and SQL Server.
