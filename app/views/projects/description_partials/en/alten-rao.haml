I did my 4th year internship at the

    .important Defining of needs
    &raquo; Determine, through a detailed study of the client's needs, a list of the requirements for the project as well as the technical risks.

    &raquo; Converting the needs into a solution by establishing a tool matching these ones.

.important Technology watch 
also takes an important place in order to always offer the best technical solution to a prospective future client. As a consequence, I realized studies on various technologies (RoR; Drupal, HTML5) to determine what their assets are and in which case using them would be a good choice.
